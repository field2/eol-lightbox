== Description ==

This plugin transforms the Gutenberg gallery block into a lightbox with previous/next navigation. It was built to offer those who wish to present a series of images in lightbox/slider format with a simple, lightweight solution.

= Installation =


* Install the plugin through the Install Plugins interface or by uploading the `gutenberg_gallery_lightbox` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the Gallery Blocks Lightbox plugin.
* Make sure you select "Media File" in the Link To dropdown menu for your gallery


= Why did you make this plugin? =

I haven't found a lightbox that is optimized for Gutenberg galleries. Many generate their own gallery formats or contain unneccesary options. I wanted to build one that was as minimal as possible, while offering a functional and elegant experience.
